                  Im Angeline Seveses, 19 years old from Binalonan, Pangasinan.
                  My number one hobby is drawing. I always do it whenever Im bored
                  becuase it makes me feel happy. I started drawing when I was child
                  and I've been encountered different techniques that motivates me to 
                  explore more in arts not just in drawing. Now, I also do painting sceneries
                  with the use of acrylic or either oil pastels. My second hobby 
                  is biking, in nearby places in my town 
                  together with my family becuase in this way we become phusically active
                  which is good in our health as well as we created happy memories that I will
                  treasure forever. My last hobby which I always do all the time is watching youtube videos. 
                  I love watching people who plays horror games as well as I love watching lifestyle type 
                  of vlog becuase somehow I learn something from them and motivates me as well. 
                  One of my unforgetable happening in my life is when I was child, I remembered that my father is my first supporter
                  of my own talent which is drawing. He always guides me, motivates 
                  me and inspires me because he is a great carpenter and painter 
                  as well. He is the one who boost me to continue my talent
                  and be grateful and every things that I have. As well as he is the one who
                  thought me to value education, becuase education will be my key to a better life
                  that we dream for in the future. 
                  Im just living in a simple life and a simple family. And Im 
                  proud that I have them because eventhough my parents didn't finished 
                  their studies, they can still provide what we need inside the house. 
                  My dream place to travel in the future is the tourist destinations of
                  our country. Becuase me myself was mesmerized and proud on the beauty that
                  they have.
